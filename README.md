## Usage / Instructions
From the main menu, clicking the 'Play' button will navigate to the lobby menu, this is where any of the gamemodes can be selected and played. A shortcut to the campaign as well as navigation to the game's options is also provided.

### Gamemode Settings
The current settings of the gamemode (things such as word length, difficulty, time limits) can be configured by clicking the 'Gamemode Settings' button below the name of the gamemode in the header. When exiting the gamemode, the most recently used settings will be saved. Additionally, a preset of settings can be saved for future use, just change the settings, provide a name for the preset and click the 'Save Preset' button. This preset can then be loaded at any time by clicking the 'Load Preset' button and selecting the preset by name.

Gamemode settings can not be configured for campaign levels!
### Challenges
When at the lobby menu (where gamemodes are selected), a list of challenges can be seen towards the right-hand side. Complete these challenges by fulfilling their descriptions/criteria. Once a challenge has been completed, it will shimmer and the reward of gold coins can be collected by clikcing the 'Redeem' button.

### Campaign
Whilst any gamemode can be played by selecting it from the lobby menu, there is also a campaign of predetermined levels! These levels are grouped into areas according to their topic or context (for instance, levels within the 'Travel' area may include guessing target words that are countries or cities!). Completing a level unlocks the next level in the area and all levels in an area must be completed for the next area to be unlocked!
